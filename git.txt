When you begin a new task:
Ensure you have the latest version of develop (git pull) 
	feature Branch from develop, make your branch name something meaningful
	Checkout the branch
		Do your work
		Compile and test your code
	Push your branch to gitlab
	Wait for the CI pipeline to report success (or fix any failures it detects)
Merge your change into develop

Release branch:
Create a release branch from develop
	Test it locally
	Deploy it to your production server manually
	Test it on production
	Merge the release branch into master
	Tag master with a version number.
Merge master into develop (this brings any bug fixes you did in the release branch back into develop)
